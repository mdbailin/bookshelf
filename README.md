# A Bookshelf with API Functionality

This project is a virtual bookshelf for Udacity students. You are able to add their books to the bookshelf, give them a rating, update the rating and search through their book lists. As a part of the Fullstack Nanodegree, it serves as a practice module for lessons from Course 2: API Development and Documentation. By completing this project, students in the program learn and apply their skills structuring and implementing well formatted API endpoints that leverage knowledge of HTTP and API development best practices. 

All backend code follows [PEP8 style guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). 

## Getting Started

### Pre-requisites and Local Development 
Developers using this project should already have Python3, pip and node installed on their local machines.

#### Backend

From the backend folder run `pip install requirements.txt`. All required packages are included in the requirements file. 

To run the application run the following commands: 
```
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```

These commands put the application in development and directs our application to use the `__init__.py` file in our flaskr folder. Working in development mode shows an interactive debugger in the console and restarts the server whenever changes are made. If running locally on Windows, look for the commands in the [Flask documentation](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/tutorial/factory/).

The application is run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` by default and is a proxy in the frontend configuration. 

#### Frontend

From the frontend folder, run the following commands to start the client: 
```
npm install // only once to install dependencies
npm start 
```

By default, the frontend will run on localhost:3000. 

### Tests
In order to run tests navigate to the backend folder and run the following commands: 

```
dropdb bookshelf_test
createdb bookshelf_test
psql bookshelf_test < books.psql
python test_flaskr.py
```

The first time you run the tests, omit the dropdb command. 

All tests are kept in that file and should be maintained as updates are made to app functionality. 
##API Reference

### Getting Started
- Base URL: This app is only run locally and is not hosted as a base URL. The backend app is hosted at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`, which is set as a proxy on the frontend.
- Authentication: This app does not require authentication or API keys.


### Error Handling
Errors are returned as JSON objects in the following format:
```
{
    "success": False, 
    "error": 404,
    "message": "Not found"
}
```
There are four error types the app may return when a request fails:
- 400: Bad Request
- 404: Not Found
- 405: Method Not Allowed
- 422: Unprocessable

### Endpoints
#### GET / Books
- General:
    - Returns a list of book objects, success value, and the total number of books currently in the database
    - Results are paginated in groups of 8. Includes a request argument to start at any page number (defaults to 1).
- Sample: `curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/books`
